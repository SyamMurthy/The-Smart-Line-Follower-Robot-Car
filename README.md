# The-Smart-Line-Follower-Robot-Car


This project details the development of an autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) designed for real-time object tracking and following.

Utilizing a combination of microcontroller (e.g., Arduino)  and a Sensors , the robot car can detect a designated target (e.g., a person or colored object) and autonomously adjust its speed and direction to maintain a safe, predetermined following distance. Key functionalities include robust tracking the line and sensor-based obstacle avoidance.

Goal: To create an efficient and reliable platform for personal assistance, automated warehouse transport, or educational robotics.
